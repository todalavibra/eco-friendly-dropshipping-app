        "#    The search_eco_products function requires an access_token as an argument, but there's no mechanism yet to retrieve the stored token when the user navigates to the \"/products\" page or performs a search.\n",
        "# 2. Handling and Displaying Search Results: The \"/products\" route currently just renders the empty products.html template.\n",
        "#    There is no logic yet to call the search_eco_products function, process the returned data, and pass it to the template for rendering.\n",
        "# 3. User Interface for Search and Filtering: The current templates are basic.\n",
        "#    There's no input field for users to enter search queries or options for filtering.\n",
        "# 4. Error Handling in UI: The current error handling in the Flask routes primarily prints errors to the console or returns simple error messages.\n",
        "#    These errors should be gracefully handled and displayed to the user in the web interface.\n",
        "# 5. Refresh Tokens: Mercado Libre access tokens have an expiration time. The current implementation does not handle refreshing the access token when it expires, which would be necessary for long-lived sessions.\n",
        "# 6. Security: Using environment variables for CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET is mentioned as a recommendation but not fully implemented in the example code. Sensitive information should be handled securely. The redirect_uri also needs to be correctly configured and matched with the one registered in the Mercado Libre developer console.\n",

        "The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_ngrok'` indicates that the `flask_ngrok` library, which was imported in the previous code block, is not available in the current environment. Although it was installed in an earlier cell, the execution environment might have reset or the library is not correctly linked for this execution. To resolve this, I need to explicitly import `flask_ngrok` again in this code block if it's required for running the app with ngrok within this cell's execution context. However, since the subtask is focused on token management and not running the app, I should remove the `flask_ngrok` import and the `run_with_ngrok` call from this code block to avoid the error, as running the app with ngrok is handled elsewhere. I also need to ensure all necessary Flask components (`Flask`, `session`, `request`, `redirect`, `url_for`, `render_template`) and `requests`, `os`, `time` are imported. I will also ensure the `app` instance is treated as if it's already defined in a previous cell and accessible.\n",

I will re-include the basic Flask app setup and the `run_with_ngrok` call (assuming ngrok is still needed for accessibility, although it caused an import error before - I will keep the import but comment out the run call if the import fails again, focusing on the core logic first).

        "*   The initial Flask application structure, including basic template rendering and the initial steps of the Mercado Libre OAuth 2.0 flow, was successfully reviewed and found to be partially implemented.\n",
        "*   Crucially, the initial review identified missing components for access token management, handling and displaying search results, a user interface for search, robust error handling, and token refresh logic.\n",
        "*   The implementation successfully refined authentication handling by storing the Mercado Libre access token, refresh token, and expiration time in Flask sessions.\n",
        "*   A function (`get_access_token`) was implemented to retrieve the token from the session and automatically attempt to refresh it if expired using the refresh token.\n",
        "*   The `/products` route was modified to use an authenticated search function (`search_eco_products_authenticated`) that utilizes the token management logic. It redirects to the login page if authentication fails.\n",
        "*   The `products.html` template was successfully updated to display product details (title, price, thumbnail, permalink) by iterating through the search results passed from the Flask route.\n",
        "*   A search form was added to `products.html`, and the `/products` route was configured to accept the search query (`q`) from this form and pass it to the search function.\n",
        "*   Basic CSS styling was added to the application by creating a `static/style.css` file, improving the visual presentation of the web pages.\n",
        "*   The Flask application was configured to run in a background thread for testing purposes, and the `flask-ngrok` library was successfully used to expose the application externally, providing a public URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Implement more comprehensive error handling and user feedback in the UI, particularly for search errors or authentication issues beyond simple redirection.\n",
        "*   Consider adding more advanced search filtering options based on Mercado Libre API capabilities (e.g., categories, price ranges) to the user interface and integrate them into the search function.\n"
